Problem is to find the method of combining a list of mixtures in such a way that generated smoke is minimized.
It is given that smoke generated when 2 mixtures are combined = a * b where a, b are flavors of the mixtures.
Also, combining 2 mixtures generates a new mixture of flavor (a + b) % 100

Found the problem [here][spoj].  

Solution
===

Mixtures is a standard matrix chain multiplication problem variation with a bit of a twist. Once it is realized that we
need to keep start and end index in the list as the dp states, storing smoke generated for each such subarray in the
table, we encounter another problem that how to store the resultant flavor/type of the mixture as a result of the
combination. The key insight here is that since we take mod at each step, we can keep an array where the ith value
indicates the resultant value of combining mixtures for all j <= i (j >= 0). Therefore to find resultant type of mixture
which is a result of combining mixtures from index i to j, we can simply do (100 + array[j] - array[i]) % 100 (where j >
i).

Complete code follows:

```cpp

#include <iostream>
#include <limits>

using namespace std;

int arr[101];
long long dp[101][101];
int val[102];

int main() {
  int n;
  while(~scanf("%d", &n)) {
    for (int i=0; i<n; i++) {
      scanf("%d", &arr[i]);
    }

    val[0] = 0;
    for (int i=1; i<=n; i++) {
      val[i] = (val[i-1] + arr[i-1])%100;
    }

    for (int L=1; L<n; L++) {
      for (int i=0; i<n-L; i++) {

        int j = i + L;
        dp[i][j] = numeric_limits<long long>::max();

        int diff1, diff2;
        for (int k=i; k<j; k++) {
          diff1 = (100 + val[k+1] - val[i])%100;
          diff2 = (100 + val[j+1] - val[k+1])%100;
          long long smoke = dp[i][k] + dp[k+1][j] + diff1*diff2;//(val[k+1]-val[i])*(val[j+1] - val[k+1]);
          if (smoke < dp[i][j])
            dp[i][j] = smoke;
        }
      }
    }

    printf("%lld\n", dp[0][n-1]);
  }
  return 0;

}

```
